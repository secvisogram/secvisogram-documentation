<h1 data-number="1" id="document"><span
class="header-section-number">1</span> Document</h1>
<p>Contains all metadata that is required to identify the advisory. This
includes, among other things, the title and category (profile) of the
document, as well as the publisher and version history.</p>
<p>A machine-readable advisory requires the same - or more - information
than the human-readable version. If more information is provided than in
the human-readable format, this should be noted for the review of the
document. The human-readable advisory must be derivable from the
machine-readable one. The machine-readable document is superordinated to
the human-readable document.</p>
<p><strong>Category</strong></p>
<p>This value determines the profile name for the CSAF document. It
should always be the value of the profile defined in the <a
href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf/v2.0/csaf-v2.0.html#4-profiles">specification</a>.</p>
<p>The selected profile has an impact on how the document is validated.
It is highly encouraged to use the defined CSAF profiles.</p>
<p>The available profiles are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>csaf_base</code></li>
<li><code>csaf_informational_advisory</code></li>
<li><code>csaf_security_incident_response</code></li>
<li><code>csaf_security_advisory</code></li>
<li><code>csaf_vex</code></li>
</ul>
<p>As advisories with category <code>csaf_base</code> do not provide
much value, it is recommended to use a higher profile. For validation,
the profile <code>csaf_base</code> is always used as fallback. With this
profile, fewer validations are carried out. In general, if in doubt, use
a higher profile containing more information.</p>
<p>A company may introduce custom categories, which will also lead to
<code>csaf_base</code> being used as fallback for validation.</p>
<p>For a document with the profile <code>csaf_base</code> the category
value must not be equal to the (case insensitive) name (without the
prefix <code>csaf_</code>) or value of any other profile than “CSAF
Base”. Any occurrences of dash, whitespace, and underscore characters
are removed from the values on both sides before the match. Also, the
value must not start with the reserved prefix <code>csaf_</code> except
if the value is <code>csaf_base</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Csaf Version</strong></p>
<p>Must be set to <code>2.0</code> which is currently the only valid
value.</p>
<p><strong>Lang</strong></p>
<p>The language the document is written in.</p>
<p>Must not be the same as <code>/document/source_lang</code>.</p>
<p>Helps the consumer to automatically filter the documents according to
his language. Can also be used to sort the documents by language within
the distribution mechanism (see section 7 of the specification).</p>
<p>As part of the document creation process, the language helps to run a
spell checker. Therefore, it should be as specific as possible and
reasonable: e.g. use <code>en-US</code> or <code>en-GB</code> instead of
just <code>en</code>.</p>
<p>Further description of this type can be found under <a
href="#md-merge-link-1">types</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Source Lang</strong></p>
<p>This field must be present and set if the value
<code>translator</code> is used in
<code>/document/publisher/categoy</code> to indicate the language of the
original document. If the document was not translated, this field should
not be set.</p>
<p>The source language must not be the same as the document language in
<code>/document/lang</code>.</p>
<p>Further description of this type can be found under <a
href="#md-merge-link-2">types</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Title</strong></p>
<p>The title should provide a quick overview of what this document is
about to the user.</p>
<p>Typically, a product name is referenced. For vulnerabilities that
became more well known, several exemplary products may be listed.</p>
<p><em>Examples:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><code>Product A affected by RCE</code></li>
<li><code>Multiple Products affected by Log4Shell Vulnerability</code></li>
<li><code>Product Family X affected by Vulnerability Y</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 data-number="1.1" id="acknowledgments"><span
class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Acknowledgments</h2>
<p>Acknowledgments of people and organizations that were involved in
discovery, publication and coordination of the process that lead to the
CSAF document.</p>
<p>The acknowledgments are an important tool to reward and honor
security researchers and contribute to the reputation of an
organization.</p>
<p>In contrast to the Vulnerability Acknowledgments
(<code>/vulnerabilities[]/acknowledgments</code>) contributions to the
whole document can be honored.</p>
<p>Listing coordinating entities is recommended but not required.</p>
<p>Further description of this type can be found under <a
href="#md-merge-link-3">types</a>.</p>
<h2 data-number="1.2" id="aggregate-severity"><span
class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Aggregate Severity</h2>
<p>Vendor assessment of the overall criticality of the vulnerabilities
in the document.</p>
<p>This could, for example, be the textual description of the base
severity corresponding to the highest CVSS score.</p>
<p><strong>Namespace</strong></p>
<p>Reference to an explanation of the meaning of the severity
rating.</p>
<p><strong>Text</strong></p>
<p>Represents overall assessment and should be a string from a closed
set. The set may be vendor-specific or come from an applicable
standard.</p>
<p><em>Examples:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/CERTCC/SSVC">SSVC decision or
vector</a></li>
<li><a
href="https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/">Red

<li>Assessment according to the German Advisory Format (DAF)</li>
<li>Rating between 1 and 5</li>
</ul>
<h2 data-number="1.3" id="distribution"><span
class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Distribution</h2>
<p>Specifies how and to whom the document can be distributed.</p>
<p>Classification according to TLP is preferred because it is
machine-processable.</p>
<p><strong>Text</strong></p>
<p>A textual description of how the document may be distributed.</p>
<p>The use of TLP labels is preferred.</p>
<h3 data-number="1.3.1" id="tlp"><span
class="header-section-number">1.3.1</span> TLP</h3>
<p>The Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) is a standardized agreement for the
exchange of information worthy of protection (see <a
href="https://www.first.org/tlp/docs/tlp-v1.pdf">https://www.first.org/tlp/docs/tlp-v1.pdf</a>).</p>
<p>Public Advisories should generally be classified as
<code>TLP:WHITE</code>.</p>
<p>If there are prior obligations to inform a closed user group, these
should be distributed as <code>TLP:AMBER</code> or
<code>TLP:RED</code>.</p>
<p>In principle, <a href="https://www.first.org/tlp/">the definition of
FIRST</a> applies. If a different definition has been agreed with the
customer group, this must be specified with a URL
(<code>/document/distribution/tlp/url</code>).</p>
<p><strong>Label</strong></p>
<p>The label should be set and must be valid. There are four traffic
light values:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>RED</code> - <em>Not for disclosure, restricted to
participants only</em>:</p>
<p>In the context of a meeting, for example, <code>TLP:RED</code>
information is limited to those present at the meeting. The distribution
of <code>TLP:RED</code> information will generally be via a defined list
and in some circumstances may only be passed verbally or in
person.</p></li>
<li><p><code>AMBER</code> - <em>Limited disclosure, restricted to
participants’ organizations</em>:</p>
<p>The recipient may share <code>TLP:AMBER</code> information with
others within their organization, but only on a ‘need-to-know’ basis.
The originator may be expected to specify the intended limits of that
sharing.</p></li>
<li><p><code>GREEN</code> - <em>Limited disclosure, restricted to the
community</em>:</p>
<p>Information in this category can be circulated widely within a
particular community. However, the information may not be published or
posted publicly on the Internet, nor released outside the
community.</p></li>
<li><p><code>WHITE</code> - <em>Disclosure is not limited</em>:</p>
<p>Subject to standard copyright rules, <code>TLP:WHITE</code>
information may be distributed freely, without restriction.</p></li>

<h2 data-number="1.4" id="notes"><span
class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Notes</h2>
<p>For CSAF advisories that contain a <code>product_tree</code>, a short
description of the products should be included. This should have the
category <code>description</code> and the title “Product Description”.
In this note, the product should be described in more detail in terms of
functionality and benefits in a few sentences. This applies analogously
to product families.</p>
<p>Another element with title “General Security Recommendations” and
category <code>general</code> should be created.</p>
<p>Another element of the category <code>summary</code> that summarizes
vulnerabilities should be created.</p>
<p>Adding a legal disclaimer for the document is encouraged.</p>
<p>FAQs, if not vulnerability specific, belong in this section.</p>

<p><em>Additional details for profile CSAF Informational
Advisory</em></p>
<p>For the <code>csaf_informational_advisory</code> profile at least one
note must exist which has a <code>category</code> of
<code>description</code>, <code>details</code>, <code>general</code> or
<code>summary</code>. It should contain information what the “issue” is
about and describe it as well as countermeasures or recommended
actions.</p>
<p><em>Additional details for profile CSAF Security Incident
Response</em></p>
<p>For the <code>csaf_security_incident_response</code> profile at least
one note must exist which has a <code>category</code> of
<code>description</code>, <code>details</code>, <code>general</code> or
<code>summary</code>. The response should be detailed. It may touch on
impacts and recommended actions. The response should be clearly marked
as such - e.g. through the title of the note.</p>
<h2 data-number="1.5" id="publisher"><span
class="header-section-number">1.5</span> Publisher</h2>
<p>Contains all information about the issuing party of the CSAF
document.</p>
<p><strong>Category</strong></p>
<p>The publisher’s category is useful for the reader to understand the
perspective of the publisher. This information enables the consumer to
estimate the trustworthiness of the advisory.</p>
<p>The valid values are</p>
<ul>
<li><code>coordinator</code></li>
<li><code>discoverer</code></li>
<li><code>other</code></li>
<li><code>translator</code></li>
<li><code>user</code></li>
<li><code>vendor</code></li>
</ul>
<p>In most cases the value <code>vendor</code> is correct. If the value
<code>translator</code> is used, the field
<code>/document/source_lang</code> must be set.</p>
<p><strong>Contact Details</strong></p>
<p>Lists options of contacting the publisher of the advisories.</p>
<p>At least one email address should be given for queries about the CSAF
document. Email addresses of functions are preferred since people may
change but the functional mailbox remains. If in doubt, a website with a
contact form can also be given. For quick queries, a telephone number
can also be provided. Listing postal addresses is unusual but
possible.</p>
<p>It can be useful, especially if a telephone number is given, as it
helps to get an idea what timezone the team is located in.</p>
<p><strong>Issuing Authority</strong></p>
<p>Used to define responsibilities. Can also be used to establish
geographical responsibility, e.g. Cert only for national security
researchers and/or vendors. It is mostly used for sectoral, geographical
or organizational specialization.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>ICS-CERT may state that “[they] coordinate any ICS related
vulnerabilities”. This means that ICS-CERT is not the right team to talk
with in regards to IT products (e.g. Microsoft Exchange).</li>
</ul>
<p>Especially relevant for large companies/organizations or managed
service providers. Also relevant if there are several teams that issue
advisories within the same group.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Despite the “similar” name of “Siemens” and “Siemens Energy”,
responsibilities can be described more clearly.</li>
</ul>
<p>The value should be a full text description.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>“Example Company PSIRT is responsible for any vulnerabilities
related to Example Company’s products or services.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Name</strong></p>
<p>The name of the issuing party. Typically, the company name or the
name of the Product Security Team.</p>
<p><em>Examples:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><code>Example Company PSIRT</code> (Product Security Incident
Response Team)</li>
<li><code>ProductCERT</code> (Product Computer Emergency Response
Team)</li>
<li><code>Example Company</code></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Namespace</strong></p>
<p>The namespace is useful to unambiguously and globally identify the
vendor or manufacturer.</p>
<p>Often times a URL of the company or issuing party is used which is
recommended. Can also be a URL pointing to a page on which advisories
are published.</p>
<p>In combination with the tracking ID
(<code>/document/tracking/id</code>) the CSAF document is uniquely
identifiable. If the document version is added to that combination, a
single version of the document is globally uniquely identified.</p>
<h2 data-number="1.6" id="references"><span
class="header-section-number">1.6</span> References</h2>
<p>There should be one reference item that provides a canonical URL for
this document: It has the category <code>self</code>, the
<code>url</code> starts with <code>https://</code> and ends with a valid
filename for the CSAF document according to the rules in <a
href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf/v2.0/csaf-v2.0.html#51-filename">section
5.1. of the specification</a>.</p>
<p>All links that have any relevance in the overall context of the
document should be listed here. This could include original advisories,
advisories of the manufacturer or advisories of the coordinator. If
other advisories (especially from suppliers) are referenced, they should
be listed here.</p>
<p>It is recommended to include links to the recommended cybersecurity
best practices documents of the organization and the website which lists
the advisories.</p>
<p>CVE entries should only be linked in the corresponding vulnerability
item.</p>
<p>Further description of this type can be found under <a
href="#md-merge-link-5">types</a>.</p>
<p><em>Additional details for profile CSAF Informational
Advisory</em></p>
<p>For the <code>csaf_informational_advisory</code> profile at least one
reference must exist which has links to an <code>external</code> source.
The sources linked in such external references may be documents or
websites providing more details about the issue or its remediation (if
possible). This could be a hardening guide, a manual, best practices or
any other helpful information.</p>
<p><em>Additional details for profile CSAF Security Incident
Response</em></p>
<p>For the <code>csaf_security_incident_response</code> profile at least
one reference must exist which has links to an <code>external</code>
source. The sources linked in such external references may be documents
or websites providing more details about the incident.</p>
<h2 data-number="1.7" id="tracking"><span
class="header-section-number">1.7</span> Tracking</h2>
<p>Provides all meta information required for tracking the document and
its lifecycle. This includes the change history and the current
state.</p>
<p><strong>Current Release Date</strong></p>
<p>Defines when the current version of the document was published.</p>
<p>Should not be older than the <code>date</code> of the newest item in
Revision History (<code>/document/tracking/revision_history</code>).</p>
<p>The time should reference the point in time of the actual (planned)
publication.</p>
<p><strong>ID</strong></p>
<p>The unique name of the document within the issuing party.</p>
<p>In combination with the publisher namespace
(<code>/document/publisher/namespace</code>) the CSAF document is
globally identifiable. If the document version is added to that
combination, a single version of the document is globally uniquely
identified.</p>
<p>The tracking ID remains constant when a new version of the document
is released.</p>
<p>The filename of the document is derived from this ID as described in
the <a
href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf/v2.0/csaf-v2.0.html#51-filename">specification</a>.</p>
<p>The ID is typically a combination of a short identifier of the
issuing party, year and a sequential number. The recommended format is
“CompanyAbbreviation-YYYY-#####”</p>
<p><em>Examples:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><code>ECSA-2022-00123</code> (Example Company Security
Advisory)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Initial Release Date</strong></p>
<p>The date when the first version of the document was published. In
pre-release versions the planned publication date is used.</p>
<p>The value should not be older than the <code>date</code> of the
oldest item in Revision History
(<code>/document/tracking/revision_history</code>). Typically, this is
identical to the oldest element in the revision history. For published
documents, the oldest item has the <code>number</code> value of
<code>1</code> for <a
href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf/v2.0/csaf-v2.0.html#31112-version-type---semantic-versioning">integer
versioning</a> and <code>1.0.0</code> for <a
href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf/v2.0/csaf-v2.0.html#31111-version-type---integer-versioning">semantic
versioning</a>. The value of initial release date does not change
anymore after publication of that first version.</p>
<p>The time should reference the point in time of the actual (planned)
publication.</p>
<p><strong>Status</strong></p>
<p>The working status of the document. Possible values are
<code>draft</code>, <code>interim</code> and <code>final</code>.</p>
<p>Must be set to <code>draft</code> for all draft versions,
i.e. whenever the version is <code>0</code> or <code>0.x.y</code>, or
contains a pre-release part.</p>
<p>If it is foreseeable that updates will come in high frequency within
the next days, then the value <code>interim</code> should be selected.
The status <code>interim</code> asks the consumer to check the advisory
more often for updates. This is especially the case for vulnerabilities
where there are frequent updates while the analysis is still running
(e.g. like Log4Shell).</p>
<p>The value <code>final</code> should be chosen for all versions where
no exceptionally high frequency of updates is expected. For example, if
advisories are released once a month on a regular patch day, the value
<code>final</code> can be specified. If it is generally not foreseeable
that changes will be made at the time of release, the value
<code>final</code> should be selected.</p>
<p><strong>Version</strong></p>
<p>The version of the present document.</p>
<p>The version may still contain pre-release information (e.g. 1.0.0-17)
or build metadata for documents in <code>draft</code> status. For
documents in <code>interim</code> or <code>final</code> status no
pre-release information must be included.</p>
<p>In general, a distinction is made between integer versioning and
semantic versioning. With integer versioning the version number is
incremented by one for every public release. With semantic versioning
the version number has the form <code>MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH</code> and the
individual parts are incremented under certain conditions. Whenever the
operator needs to do a new matching run on his asset database (matching
the products from the CSAF product tree with deployed products) the
<code>MAJOR</code> version is incremented. For small changes such as
correcting typos, the <code>PATCH</code> version is incremented. All
changes in between trigger an increase of the <code>MINOR</code>
version. The exact rules of the versioning schemes are defined in <a
href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf/v2.0/cs02/csaf-v2.0-cs02.html#3111-version-type">section
3.1.11 of the specification</a>.</p>

<h3 data-number="1.7.1" id="aliases"><span
class="header-section-number">1.7.1</span> Aliases</h3>
<p>Aliases can be used to indicate the number, identifier or name
assigned to this advisory, case or issue by the coordinator,
manufacturer, supplier or other party. This can also include internal
ticket numbers.</p>
<p>The aliases should not be used to list identifiers of single
vulnerabilities which are listed in
<code>/vulnerabilities[]/ids</code>.</p>
<p><em>Examples:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><code>ICSA-20-168-01</code></li>
<li><code>VU#257161</code></li>
<li><code>Ripple20</code></li>

<h3 data-number="1.7.2" id="generator"><span
class="header-section-number">1.7.2</span> Generator</h3>
<p>The generator that was used to generate the CSAF document.</p>
<p><strong>Date</strong></p>
<p>The date when the document was generated.</p>
<p>May be different from the <code>current_release_date</code>.</p>
<h4 data-number="1.7.2.1" id="engine"><span
class="header-section-number">1.7.2.1</span> Engine</h4>
<p>Filled in by the generating program.</p>
<p><strong>Name</strong></p>
<p>Filled in by the generating program, represents the name of the
program.</p>
<p><em>Examples:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><code>Red Hat SDEngine</code></li>
<li><code>Secvisogram</code></li>
<li><code>TVCE</code></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Version</strong></p>
<p>Different versions of the generator may generate CSAF documents with
potentially different structure. Based on this value, different paths
may need to be used for matching.</p>
<p><em>Examples:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>A company may change their name and in consequence
<code>full_product_name</code>s and the generation of document changes.
This would require an adjustment of matching.</li>
</ul>
<p>A change in versioning (e.g. switching from <a
href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf/v2.0/csaf-v2.0.html#31112-version-type---semantic-versioning">integer
versioning</a> to <a
href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf/v2.0/csaf-v2.0.html#31111-version-type---integer-versioning">semantic
versioning</a>) requires a change in matching.</p>
<p><em>Examples:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><code>0.6.0</code></li>
<li><code>1.0.0-beta+exp.sha.a1c44f85</code></li>
<li><code>2</code></li>
</ul>
<h3 data-number="1.7.3" id="revision-history"><span
class="header-section-number">1.7.3</span> Revision History</h3>
<p>The revision history is used to track the development of the document
in at least all published versions. There must be an entry in the
revision history for each published version. For pre-release versions
there are no entries in the version history. However, before the first
release, the field can be used to record changes.</p>
<p>The revision items sorted by date must have <code>number</code>
values in ascending order.</p>
<p>The <code>number</code> of the revision item with the most recent
<code>date</code> value must be the same as in
<code>/document/tracking/version</code>. For this comparison build
metadata is ignored. If the document status is <code>draft</code> any
pre-release part is also ignored.</p>
<p>The revision items sorted by date must not omit a version
<code>number</code>. In case of <a
href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf/v2.0/csaf-v2.0.html#31111-version-type---integer-versioning">semantic
versioning</a>, this applies only to the major version. This sorted list
of version numbers must start with (major) version <code>0</code> for
documents in <code>draft</code> status or <code>1</code> in
<code>final</code> or <code>interim</code> status.</p>
<p>The same version <code>number</code> must not be repeated for
multiple revision items.</p>
<p>The oldest revision item should not have a newer <code>date</code>
than the initial release date
<code>/document/tracking/initial_release_date</code>.</p>
<h4 data-number="1.7.3.1" id="revision-history-1"><span
class="header-section-number">1.7.3.1</span> Revision History</h4>
<p>An item in the revision history.</p>
<p><strong>Date</strong></p>
<p>The date when this version was published. For pre-release versions
the planned publication date is used. For final and interim versions the
actual publication date is used.</p>
<p>The value does not change anymore after publication.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The publication of an advisory was planned on 18.05. at 12:00. If
the advisory is then published at 11:30, the time should be adjusted. If
the time is not corrected before publication, it must not be changed
afterwards anymore.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Legacy Version</strong></p>
<p>The legacy version can be used to create a mapping to a
human-readable version of the document that follows a version scheme
other than <a
href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf/v2.0/csaf-v2.0.html#31112-version-type---semantic-versioning">integer
versioning</a> or <a
href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf/v2.0/csaf-v2.0.html#31111-version-type---integer-versioning">semantic
versioning</a>. This should only be used as a temporary solution - a
transition to the versioning scheme used in the CSAF document should be
aimed for.</p>
<p><strong>Number</strong></p>
<p>The document version of the document this revision history element
corresponds to is used as value here.</p>
<p>The value must not be <code>0</code> or <code>0.y.z</code> if the
document status (<code>/document/tracking/status</code>) is set to
<code>final</code> or <code>interim</code>.</p>
<p>The value must not include pre-release information and should not
include build metadata information.</p>
<p>Further description of this type can be found under <a
href="#md-merge-link-7">types</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>The summary aids the reader in initial assessment during
inspection.</p>
<p>For the initial version a short notice indicating that this refers to
this first version is sufficient, e.g. “Initial version” or “Initial
publication”.</p>
<p>For all subsequent versions the difference to the last published
version should be described as concrete as possible.</p>
<p>For pre-release versions, the changes are registered in the entry of
the next version to be released.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em></p>
<p>For version 1.1.0-1 (draft for 1.1.0) the changes are registered in
the entry for version 1.1.0.</p>
<h1 data-number="2" id="product-tree"><span
class="header-section-number">2</span> Product Tree</h1>
<p>The product tree holds all definitions of products referenced later
on in the CSAF document. This is independent of the products’
status.</p>
<p>It is recommended to model a hierarchical structure by means of
branches in the <code>product_tree</code>. The branch structure
typically consists of vendor, product name and product version. A
product family can also be listed between the vendor and product name.
This simplifies grouping and display in a human-readable advisory. The
structure depends strongly on the structure of the products and how they
are known by the consumers of the advisories.</p>
<p><em>Examples:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>There is a product family with only 2 products that are relevant for
the advisory, then the product family does not necessarily have to be
listed.</li>
<li>For a product family with 120 products for which the advisory
applies, the strong recommendation is to list the family as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>In principle software and hardware components are to be represented
separately, since hardware remains the same, even if software is
updated. This also allows separation of software that may run on
multiple hardware installations. The connections of hardware and
software are to be represented over
<code>/product_tree/relationships</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>product_identification_helper</code> facilitates the
matching between the advisory and the asset or SBOM database.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>If the name of a company changes due to an acquisition, the name
would in principle be changed from a certain version of the product. In
fact, however, other more far-reaching name changes may occur, which
should be modelled here.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Additional for profile CSAF Informational Advisory</em></p>
<p>If a <code>product_tree</code> is listed in an advisory with profile
<code>CSAF Informational Advisory</code>, then the listed products are

<h2 data-number="2.4" id="relationships"><span
class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Relationships</h2>
<p>Used to model relationships between two products of the
<code>product_tree</code>. This could be for example a connection of
hard- and software or firmware.</p>
<p>Hardware and corresponding software shall be listed separately with a
relationship to connect them.</p>
<p>As a model number (usually) does not change as a result of an update
it cannot be determined automatically whether an affected or unaffected
part is present. Thus, a relationship is required to model corresponding
software.</p>
<p>A relationship can also be used in cases of OS dependent
vulnerabilities or to represent hotfixes.</p>
<h3 data-number="2.4.1" id="relationship"><span
class="header-section-number">2.4.1</span> Relationship</h3>
<p>A relationship read as
<code>&lt;product_reference&gt; &lt;category&gt; &lt;relates_to_product_reference&gt;</code></p>
<p>Relationships are especially useful for hotfixes where the vulnerable
product is <code>installed_with</code> the fix.</p>

<h3 data-number="3.4.1" id="branch"><span
class="header-section-number">3.4.1</span> Branch</h3>
<p>The branches are used to model a hierarchical product tree.</p>
<p>Branches are preferred over <code>full_product_names</code>.</p>
<p>Products should be listed according to their version. Specifying
exact product versions is preferred over specifying version ranges.
Enumerating the products is usually easier to match on the recipients
side. Additionally, not all version ranges are deterministic.</p>
<p>Since not all required data may yet be available, version ranges are
still supported. If version ranges are used, the Version Range Specifier
(VERS) should be preferred. If this is not possible, the rules of the
Version Range Like Specifier (VLS) apply.</p>
<p>It is possible that the exact version that is affected is not known.
In this case a version range can be used.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em></p>
<p>Version 4.2 of a product may be affected and version 4.3 contains a
patch.</p>
<ul>
<li>Version 4.3 listed as fixed product version
<ul>
<li>if it is not known since which version the product is affected
<ul>
<li>&lt;=4.2 (range) listed as affected</li>
<li>or all versions below listed individually</li>
</ul></li>
<li>if it is known since which version the product is affected, the
given range or listed versions should be adjusted accordingly</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Hotfixes should be represented through the relationships. The product
without and with hotfix are listed, the first in the
<code>affected</code> product status group, the latter in the
<code>fixed</code> group.</p>
<p><strong>Category</strong></p>
<p>Specifies how the value in the adjacent name field should be
understood.</p>
<p>If the value is <code>product_version</code>, the property
<code>name</code> must not contain a version range. The following
patterns are considered to indicate a version range:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;</code></li>
<li><code>&lt;=</code></li>
<li><code>&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>&gt;=</code></li>
<li><code>after</code></li>
<li><code>all</code></li>
<li><code>before</code></li>
<li><code>earlier</code></li>
<li><code>later</code></li>
<li><code>prior</code></li>
<li><code>versions</code></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Name</strong></p>
<p>The value is further defined by the branch’s category.</p>
<p>If the <code>category</code> is <code>product_version_range</code>,
the <code>name</code> should conform to the VERS specification,
i.e. match the regex
<code>^vers:[a-z\\.\\-\\+][a-z0-9\\.\\-\\+]*/.+</code></p>

Helper</h3>
<p>A collection of different possibilities to identify a product in the
asset database or SBOM.</p>
<p>When it is used to identify a new product formed by a relationship no
value must be the same to any of the products that make up the
relationship. Otherwise, a matching would return misleading results.</p>
<p><em>Example</em>:</p>
<p>There is an application (<code>Product A</code>) that has the same
hash on Linux and Windows and a vulnerability is found that affects the
program when being executed on Windows but not on Linux. If the same
hash would be linked in the relationship that forms the products
<code>Product A installed on Windows</code> and
<code>Product A installed on Linux</code>, a matching algorithm would
return the same list of assets for all 3 product IDs. However, that is
an ambiguous match.</p>
<p><strong>Cpe</strong></p>
<p>Common Platform Enumeration, see <a
href="https://cpe.mitre.org/specification/">cpe.mitre.org</a>. Can be
CPE 2.2 and CPE 2.3, while 2.3 is preferred.</p>
<p>When using CPE, please be aware of the limitations and that it might
be deprecated in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Purl</strong></p>
<p>A purl is a URL composed of seven components which are separated by a
specific character for unambiguous parsing:</p>
<pre class="text"><code>scheme:type/namespace/name@version?qualifiers#subpath</code></pre>
<p>The definition for each component is:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>scheme</code>: this is the URL scheme with the constant value
of “pkg”. One of the primary reason for this single scheme is to
facilitate the future official registration of the “pkg” scheme for
package URLs. Required.</li>
<li><code>type</code>: the package “type” or package “protocol” such as
maven, npm, nuget, gem, pypi, etc. Required.</li>
<li><code>namespace</code>: some name prefix such as a Maven groupid, a
Docker image owner, a GitHub user or organization. Optional and
type-specific.</li>
<li><code>name</code>: the name of the package. Required.</li>
<li><code>version</code>: the version of the package. Optional.</li>
<li><code>qualifiers</code>: extra qualifying data for a package such as
an OS, architecture, a distro, etc. Optional and type-specific.</li>
<li><code>subpath</code>: extra subpath within a package, relative to
the package root. Optional.</li>
</ul>
<p>Components are designed such that they form a hierarchy from the most
significant component on the left to the least significant component on
the right.</p>
<p>A purl must NOT contain a URL Authority i.e. there is no support for
username, password, host and port components. A namespace segment may
sometimes look like a host but its interpretation is specific to a type.
Also, a purl does not contain double slashes <code>//</code>, that is
the scheme is <code>pkg:</code>. There</p>
<p>Purls are particularly well suited for identifying components within
the package types supported by purl.</p>

<h3 data-number="4.1.8" id="product-status"><span
class="header-section-number">4.1.8</span> Product Status</h3>
<p>The product status provides information on the status products in the
<code>product_tree</code> are in.</p>
<p>Generally, vulnerable (<code>known_affected</code>) and fixed
(<code>fixes</code>) versions of products should be given.</p>
<p>The different lists of product status groups contain the IDs of
corresponding products. The same product ID must not be member of
contradicting product status groups. I.e. a product listed in the group
of <em>affected</em> products must not be listed again in the group of
<em>not affected</em> products.</p>
<p>The contradicting groups are</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>affected</em></p>
<ul>
<li><code>product_status/first_affected[]</code></li>
<li><code>product_status/known_affected[]</code></li>
<li><code>product_status/last_affected[]</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>not affected</em></p>
<ul>
<li><code>product_status/known_not_affected[]</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>fixed</em></p>
<ul>
<li><code>product_status/first_fixed[]</code></li>
<li><code>product_status/fixed[]</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>under investigation</em></p>
<ul>
<li><code>product_status/under_investigation[]</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Each product listed in the <em>affected</em> group should be
referenced in at least one remediation item
(<code>/vulnerabilities[]/remediations</code>).</p>
<p>For each product listed in the <em>not affected</em> group, the
reason why it is not affected should be given. This reason, also called
impact statement, should be listed in the threats
(<code>/vulnerabilities[]/threats</code>) with category
<code>impact</code> or as machine-readable status justification in the
flags (<code>/vulnerabilities[]/flags</code>). It is recommended to use
both, when applicable.</p>
<p>The status <code>known_not_affected</code> is used in the context of
security advisories to exclude individual products. This is mainly used
for products one could assume to be affected. To define general
non-affectedness, the VEX profile should be used.</p>
<p>An issuer might recommend (<code>product_status/recommended</code>) a
product version from any group. If more than one product version is
patched, the author should also specify which version is recommended. A
recommended product version can also come from the <em>affected</em>
group, i.e. if it was discovered that fixed versions introduce a more
severe vulnerability. If there are two patched versions of a
vulnerability that contain different vulnerabilities, the
<code>recommended</code> field can also be used to specify which version
is recommended for use.</p>
<p>Version boundaries can be represented in the <code>first_*</code> and
<code>last_*</code> fields. For simplification, elements from
<code>first_*</code> and <code>last_*</code> should also be listed in
the main groups <code>known_*</code>.</p>
<p>For products listed in <code>under_investigation</code> it is
expected that the outcome of analysis are reported in a later version of
the document.</p>
<p>For the <code>csaf_security_advisory</code> profile the property
<code>product_status</code> must exist.</p>
<p>For the <code>csaf_vex</code> profile at least one of the elements
<code>fixed</code>, <code>known_affected</code>,
<code>known_not_affected</code> or <code>under_investigation</code> must
be present.</p>
<p><strong>First Affected</strong></p>
<p>The product version that was affected first or with which product
version the vulnerability was introduced. All previous versions are
assumed to be unaffected.</p>
<p>The first affected version can also be an “End of Life” version.</p>

<h3 data-number="4.1.9" id="remediations"><span
class="header-section-number">4.1.9</span> Remediations</h3>
<p>All information on how to fix the vulnerability, or even if no fix is
possible.</p>
<p>For End of Life products, typically, the category
<code>no_fix_planned</code> is used.</p>
<p>If no patch or other remediation is available yet, this should be
communicated via <code>none_available</code>. It should then be
described why this is the case.</p>
<h4 data-number="4.1.9.1" id="remediation"><span
class="header-section-number">4.1.9.1</span> Remediation</h4>
<p>Each remediation must include at least one of the elements
<code>group_ids</code> or <code>product_ids</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Category</strong></p>
<p>The category indicates to which type the remediation belongs.</p>
<p>For end of life products the category <code>no_fix_planned</code> is
common. A reference to the fact that these are end of life products is
sufficient. It is best to include the date since when these products are
no longer supported. A reference to compatible successor products is
permissible and recommended. In other cases where
<code>no_fix_planned</code> is used, it should be stated why no fix has
been created or is planned. Permissible reasons include that the
hardware requirements of the mitigation measure exceed the capabilities
of the existing hardware.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>An embedded system uses 1024 RSA keys when RSA 3072 keys would be
secure but there is not enough memory to execute the computations.</li>
</ul>
<p>The value <code>none_available</code> must always be specified if no
remediation is available. Can also be specified if no patch is available
yet, but it is planned. In this case an expected release date of the
patch should be specified. Once the patch is available, a remediation
with the category <code>vendor_fix</code> will replace this
remediation.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise specified, the category <code>vendor_fix</code>
assumes that the patch fully remediates the vulnerability. If there are
any effects on functionality, these must be entered in the details of
the remediation. Additionally, installation instructions or
prerequisites can also be specified.</p>
<p>For the value <code>mitigation</code> it is crucial that the
exploitability is reduced, but the vulnerability is not completely
fixed.</p>
<p>A <code>workaround</code> describes a configuration or special
deployment that can be used to prevent the exploitability of the
vulnerability.</p>
<p>Hotfixes are usually classified as <code>workarounds</code> because
they prevent exploitability. However, hotfixes can also be classified as
<code>mitigation</code> if they do not completely fix the vulnerability.
Hotfixes can also be listed at <code>vendor_fix</code> if they
completely fix the problem.</p>
<p><strong>Date</strong></p>
<p>The date from when on the remediation is/was available.</p>
<p>This information is helpful in audits to prove from when on one was
aware of a certain remediation measure.</p>
<p><strong>Details</strong></p>
<p>The detailed description of the remediation.</p>
<p>The content is determined by the category.</p>

<p>Conditions that must be fulfilled in order to receive the patch or
implement the mitigation action.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em></p>
<p>An active support contract is required.</p>
<p><strong>Entitlement</strong></p>
<p>There is no usage documentation yet.</p>
<h5 data-number="4.1.9.1.3" id="restart-required"><span
class="header-section-number">4.1.9.1.3</span> Restart Required</h5>
<p>Specifies whether a restart is required for the mitigation measure,
and if so, in what scope.</p>
<p>This is relevant as in some cases where connections exist the scope
may be beyond a single machine.</p>
<p>This information may help in making better / risk-based decisions. A
remediation with <code>restart_required/category</code>
<code>none</code> may be applied faster than another one. The
information is also especially relevant if the product itself is
modified with the mitigating measure (workaround, mitigation, or vendor
fix).</p>
<p>If the product environment is modified (e.g., adjusting the rules of
an external firewall), it is difficult if not impossible for vendors to
determine if a restart is required.</p>
<p><strong>Category</strong></p>
<p>Specifies the type and scope of the required restart in
machine-readable form.</p>
<p>Mitigation measures that do not require a restart and can therefore
be executed during operation may be preferred.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>none</code>: No restart is necessary.</p>
<p>Example: “kill telnet process”.</p></li>
<li><p><code>vulnerable_component</code>: Only the affected product
needs to be restarted.</p>
<p>Example: natepad++ portable, exit, install new version or patch, and
restart.</p></li>
<li><p><code>service</code>: Services need to be restarted.</p>
<p>Example: <code>CVE 2019-11043</code> remote code execution in a
configuration of nginx and fpn. Service must be restarted when running
nextcloud in default configuration.</p></li>
<li><p><code>parent</code>: Is always the case when the vulnerability is
in a product running in a child process. If only the child program is
restarted, the parent program does not know that a new binary
exists.</p></li>
<li><p><code>dependencies</code>: The vulnerability in the program in
the parent process and all programs depending on it must be
restarted.</p>
<p>Example: pppd</p></li>
<li><p><code>connected</code>: All products connected to the affected
product, as well as the affected product itself, must be restarted. The
connection can be via network or other inter-process communication.</p>
<p>Example: A product that uses TLS only at the beginning and does not
do session renegotiation.</p></li>
<li><p><code>machine</code>: The entire machine must be rebooted.</p>
<p>Example: Windows 10 Semiannual Upgrade.</p></li>
<li><p><code>zone</code>: A zone consisting of multiple machines
(e.g. security zone or broadcast zone) must be restarted.</p>
<p>Example: WannaCry infecting industrial PCs which have the Write
Filter enabled. Windows reboots after infection when WannaCry tries to
encrypt the disk which removes WannaCry from this PC. However, other PCs
in the same security zone still have WannaCry and reinfect each other.
To get a clean zone, all equipment must be turned off and be rebooted
afterwards.</p></li>
<li><p><code>system</code>: A system usually consisting of multiple
zones must be restarted.</p>
<p>Example: Update to a new (encrypted) version of an industry
protocol.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Details</strong></p>
<p>The details should describe which effects a restart has, or which
procedures are to be considered with a restart.</p>
<p>Further descriptions of the scope of the restart should also be added
here.</p>
